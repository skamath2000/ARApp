Animal Time!

This is an AR App geared toward teaching kids the names, sounds, and facts of animals. The app can be installed on iOS devices.

Installation/Build

To install onto an iOS device, users must have Xcode installed and the device connected to the computer via USB. Open Builds/iOS/Unity-iPhone.xcodeproj via Xcode. Under General, ensure that your Bundle identifier is unique. Under Signing & Capabilities, choose a team to set the Provisioning Profile and Signing Certificate. Under Build Settings, under Signing, make sure that Development Team is set to the team you chose earlier and that Provisioning Profile and Code Signing Style are set to Automatic. Then, press the Build button in the top left corner of Xcode to install the app onto your device. 

Usage

After opening the app, the instructions are shown on the first screen. Click on the button to go to the next scene.

In the main scene, the user can focus the camera on one of two different images (images provided in folder Images). The app will play an audio describing the animalâ€™s name, sound, and habitat and depict a 3D version of the animal on screen.
